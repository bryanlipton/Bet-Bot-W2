# Custom GPT Prediction Fix - Final Solution

## Problem
The Custom GPT was calling the broken `/api/gpt/predict` endpoint that had a `baseballAI2.predictGame is not a function` error.

## Solution Implemented
Created a new dedicated endpoint `/api/gpt/predict-team` that:
1. Uses analytics-based prediction (no neural network dependencies)
2. Provides proper team strength calculations
3. Returns consistent JSON response format
4. Includes home field advantage calculations

## New Endpoint Details
- **URL**: `/api/gpt/predict-team`
- **Method**: POST
- **Input**: `{"homeTeam": "Yankees", "awayTeam": "Braves"}`
- **Output**: Complete prediction with probabilities, confidence, and analysis

## Files Modified
1. `server/custom-gpt-endpoint.ts` - New dedicated endpoint
2. `server/routes.ts` - Integration of new endpoint
3. `custom-gpt-openapi-3.1.yaml` - Updated schema to use new endpoint
4. `server/routes-gpt-export.ts` - Updated working endpoint path

## Test Results
- Local endpoint test: âœ… Working (Yankees 55.3% vs Braves 44.7%)
- Server logs confirm: Custom GPT prediction endpoint responding correctly
- OpenAPI schema updated to redirect Custom GPT to working endpoint

## Next Steps
Your Custom GPT should now use the working `/api/gpt/predict-team` endpoint instead of the broken one. Test with a question like "who will win yankees vs braves" to verify the fix.
