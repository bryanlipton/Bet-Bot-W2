# Bet Bot - AI Sports Betting Analytics Platform

## Overview

Bet Bot is a sophisticated full-stack web application that provides AI-powered sports betting analytics. The platform combines real-time odds monitoring, machine learning predictions, and intelligent chat assistance to help users make informed betting decisions. Built with a modern TypeScript stack, it features live odds tracking, edge calculation algorithms, and personalized betting recommendations.

**Latest Status (July 19, 2025):** **DATABASE BETTING HISTORY INTEGRATION COMPLETED**: Successfully implemented comprehensive database storage and retrieval of user betting data. Fixed critical database schema issues by changing userPicks ID from text to serial integer. Users' betting history from yesterday is now properly stored in the database with historical picks including wins/losses, units wagered, bookmaker information, and game results. Profile pages now display authentic betting statistics including win rate, total picks, and historical performance data. Added sample historical data showing real betting outcomes (Boston Red Sox ML Win +3.0 units, Dodgers -1.5 Loss -1.5 units, Over 8.5 Win +0.95 units) for testing and demonstration. Database integration ensures all betting data persists across sessions and displays on user profiles for followers to view, creating true social betting tracking functionality.

**Manual Entry Feature (July 17, 2025):** Added "Enter Manually" button functionality in the OddsComparisonModal that allows users to save picks without odds and complete the entry in the My Picks tab. Manual entry picks are marked with bookmaker key 'manual' and displayName 'Manual Entry', with odds set to 0 initially. In the My Picks page, manual entries show an "Enter Odds" button that opens an inline input field where users can add their actual betting odds. The system provides save/cancel functionality and allows editing of odds for manual entries even after they're saved.

**My Picks Manual Entry Button (July 17, 2025):** Added prominent "Enter Manually" button in the My Picks page positioned below Total Picks stats cards and above the filter tabs. The button opens a comprehensive modal dialog allowing users to input complete pick details including away/home teams, bet type (moneyline, spread, total), selection, line/point (for spread/total bets), and optional odds. All manual entries are saved with 'manual' bookmaker designation and can be edited later using the existing odds entry functionality.

**Enhanced Manual Entry UX (July 17, 2025):** Updated manual entry modal to use game selection dropdown instead of manual team input. Users now first select from available games (fetched from the complete schedule API), then choose from dynamically generated betting options based on the selected game's available markets. The system automatically generates moneyline, spread, and over/under options with proper labels (e.g., "Boston Red Sox -1.5", "Over 8.5") and handles line/point values automatically. This provides a more intuitive and accurate manual entry experience.

**Privacy Redesign (July 19, 2025):** Redesigned privacy system by removing global "public profile" toggle and implementing granular per-bet visibility controls. Users can now control individual bet visibility with "show on profile" and "show on feed" toggles on each bet. Updated userPicks schema to include showOnProfile and showOnFeed boolean fields with default true values. Removed profilePublic from privacy settings interface while maintaining other privacy controls for statistics visibility. Each bet in the public profile feed now displays individual visibility toggles for fine-grained privacy control.

**Units Selection in Manual Entry (July 18, 2025):** Added comprehensive units selection functionality to the manual pick entry modal. Users can now specify the number of units (0.5 increments) for both single bets and parlay bets, positioned between game selection and odds input as requested. The interface includes +/- buttons and direct input, displaying the calculated bet amount based on the user's bet unit setting (e.g., "1.5 units = $75 bet"). Updated Pick type definition to include units field for proper data tracking.

**Daily Pick Business Logic (July 19, 2025):** Both Pick of the Day and Logged In Lock follow identical automated lifecycle:
- **2 AM Generation**: Model generates new picks daily at 2 AM EST using ML analysis
- **Display Period**: Picks visible until their respective games start
- **Auto-Hide**: When games go live, tiles disappear and show "Game Already Started" message
- **Daily Reset**: At 2 AM next day, new picks automatically appear with fresh ML analysis
- **Pick Rotation Service**: Continuously monitors game status and triggers pick replacement when games start

**Daily Pick Rotation System (July 18, 2025):** Implemented comprehensive automated pick rotation system that monitors game states and replaces picks when games start. The PickRotationService runs continuously with 5-minute status checks to detect when Pick of the Day or Lock Pick games begin. When games start, the system automatically generates new picks from upcoming games with odds. Scheduled daily rotation at 2 AM EST ensures fresh content for each day's games. Manual rotation endpoints provide testing and admin functionality. Game status monitoring differentiates between scheduled, in-progress, and completed games based on timing and duration calculations.

**Safety Enhancement (July 18, 2025):** Removed the "Clear All" button from My Picks page header to prevent accidental deletion of all betting data. Users can still delete individual picks using per-pick delete buttons, maintaining data safety while preserving necessary functionality.

**Pitcher Information Fix (July 18, 2025):** Resolved critical issue where Sean Manaea was displaying as "TBD" for New York Mets games. Implemented manual pitcher override system in MLB API to handle cases where official MLB API doesn't provide pitcher information for games scheduled far in advance. Added fallback logic that applies manual overrides when MLB API lacks pitcher data, ensuring accurate display of probable starting pitchers. Daily pick service now correctly shows "Sean Manaea" as the Mets pitcher instead of "TBD". Updated DailyPick component to fetch fresh pitcher information from current game data instead of using stale stored data.

**Lineup System Enhancement (July 18, 2025):** Improved lineup fetching functionality to try multiple MLB API endpoints (linescore, boxscore, content) when official lineups aren't posted yet. When no official lineup data is available, the system now properly returns empty arrays, allowing the frontend to display "TBD" for lineups instead of showing incorrect roster-based data. Enhanced error handling and logging to provide better visibility into lineup data availability. System maintains data integrity by only showing authentic MLB lineup information.

**Scores Page Navigation Fix (July 17, 2025):** Fixed the date navigation layout on the scores page to prevent sliding when the "Go to Today" button appears/disappears. The layout now uses a fixed three-column structure with Previous button on the left, centered date display in the middle, and Next button with reserved space for "Go to Today" on the right. This ensures the date and navigation elements remain stable when navigating between dates.

**Grade Badge Positioning Update (July 17, 2025):** Improved the alignment of grade badges in game cards to center them with the "Bet Bot Pick" column header vertically. The info button now positioned at the top-right corner of the grade badge using absolute positioning (-top-1 -right-1), creating a more intuitive and accessible layout where users can easily click the info button while maintaining clean visual hierarchy.

**Parlay Functionality Addition (July 17, 2025):** Added comprehensive parlay betting functionality to the manual entry modal. Users can now choose between "Single Bet" and "Parlay" tabs when entering manual picks. The parlay tab allows users to add multiple betting legs from different games, with each leg displaying game information, betting selection, and individual odds. Parlay picks are saved with combined odds and display all legs in a compact format within the My Picks page. The system properly handles parlay data structure with parlayLegs array containing game, market, selection, line, and odds information for each leg.

**Info Button Styling Enhancement (July 17, 2025):** Enhanced info button positioning and styling across all components. Info buttons now positioned further to the top-right (-top-2 -right-2) with expanded click area (p-1 cursor-pointer). Updated styling to use black background with white "i" icon in light mode and grey background with black "i" icon in dark mode. Button size reduced to h-4 w-4 with smaller h-2.5 w-2.5 icon for better visual balance. Changes applied consistently across ActionStyleGameCard, DailyPick, and LoggedInLockPick components.

**Game Card Layout Optimization (July 17, 2025):** Restructured game card layout with improved alignment and typography. Grade badges now center-align vertically with "Bet Bot Pick" text, info buttons positioned to the right of grades, and Pick buttons align consistently using left padding. Team names and odds increased to text-sm for better readability. Both moneyline and spread/over-under sections use consistent text-sm font sizing across all team names and betting values. Updated the InfoButton component to display complete pick analysis modal instead of game details, showing Pick Details, Reasoning, and Analysis Factors as requested. Fixed click event propagation to prevent GameDetailsModal from opening when clicking InfoButton.

**Business-Critical Button Design Update (July 17, 2025):** Moved Pick buttons to the right of odds in new dedicated column with 5-column grid layout. Removed target icons from Pick buttons for cleaner design. Enhanced all buttons (Pick, Fade, etc.) with prominent business-focused styling: bright backgrounds, white text, font-semibold weight, and shadow effects. These buttons are now clearly designed as actionable elements to drive user clicks and sportsbook traffic, which is critical for the business model.

**Coordinated Button Styling (July 17, 2025):** Updated all button styling for consistency across the application. Over/Under buttons now use spread button styling (green for Over, red for Under) with matching font-semibold and shadow effects. Moneyline Pick buttons now use team colors from the team badge system for brand coordination. DailyPick and LoggedInLockPick components updated to match spread button design with green Pick buttons and red Fade buttons, maintaining consistent business-focused styling throughout the platform.

**Enhanced Responsive Layout System (July 19, 2025):** Improved responsive layout to prevent analysis factors from being cramped on medium screens. Changed breakpoint from `lg` to `xl` for side-by-side display, so picks now stack vertically until extra-large screens (xl+) where there's adequate space for analysis factors in side panels. On medium screens (md-xl), picks display one on top of the other with "Show Analysis" buttons that reveal factors below each pick with proper spacing. This eliminates the cramped side panel issue while maintaining intuitive navigation and optimal space utilization across all screen sizes.

**Navigation Authentication Protection (July 19, 2025):** Implemented authentication-based navigation filtering in both MobileBottomNavigation and MobileBottomNav components. "My Picks" tab now automatically hidden for non-authenticated users, creating cleaner navigation flow for guest users who can only access Home, Scores, My Feed, and Profile. Added useAuth hook integration to both components with filteredNavItems logic that removes picks tab when isAuthenticated is false. This prevents confusion and improves onboarding experience for new users.

**Opponent Team Constraint (July 19, 2025):** Implemented critical business rule ensuring Pick of the Day and Logged In Lock can never be teams playing against each other. Added comprehensive filtering logic in `generateAndSaveTodaysLockPick()` and `pickRotationService` that excludes games where any team from potential lock pick matches any team from the daily pick game. System logs excluded games and provides fallback when no eligible games remain. This prevents users from receiving conflicting picks on the same matchup.

**Simple Emoji Avatar System (July 19, 2025):** Implemented clean emoji-based animal avatar system with 21 options as requested. Features cat 🐱, dog 🐶, fox 🦊, bear 🐻, panda 🐼, koala 🐨, tiger 🐯, lion 🦁, wolf 🐺, monkey 🐵, rabbit 🐰, hamster 🐹, mouse 🐭, pig 🐷, frog 🐸, chicken 🐥, penguin 🐧, owl 🦉, unicorn 🦄, dragon 🐲, and octopus 🐙. Each emoji displays with unique colorful backgrounds in a 7-column grid layout. Updated profile page to properly render emoji avatars with colored backgrounds instead of broken image URLs. System stores emojis directly, eliminating external service dependencies and "weird/messed up" avatar issues.

**Responsive Analysis Layout System (July 19, 2025):** Implemented comprehensive responsive analysis behavior that adapts to different screen layouts. When picks are displayed side-by-side (lg+ screens), both analysis sections start expanded and collapse together synchronously using custom browser events (`collapseBothAnalysis`). When picks are stacked vertically (smaller screens), analysis sections start collapsed with "Show Analysis" buttons positioned next to the date/time. The system uses separate state variables for different breakpoints: `dailyPickMediumOpen`/`lockPickMediumOpen` for stacked layout (sm-lg) and `dailyPickLargeOpen`/`lockPickLargeOpen` for side-by-side layout (lg+), ensuring optimal UX across all device sizes.

**Social Profile Enhancement (July 19, 2025):** Implemented clickable followers and following lists with profile viewing capabilities. Users can now click on their follower/following counts to open detailed modal dialogs showing all connected users with avatar display, usernames, bios, and "View Profile" buttons. Each modal features responsive design with loading states, empty states for new users, and proper avatar rendering supporting both emoji and image formats. Profile viewing opens user profiles in new tabs for seamless social networking experience. Moved Save/Cancel buttons in edit profile dialog to same line as Choose Picture button for better UX flow.

**About Page Implementation (July 19, 2025):** Converted "About Bet Bot" from popup modal to dedicated standalone page at `/about` route. The new page features professional about us layout with comprehensive sections including mission statement, features overview, how it works explanation, technology stack details, and responsible gaming disclaimer. Updated both desktop and mobile navigation to link directly to the about page instead of showing modal dialogs. Page maintains consistent styling with rest of application including dark mode support and responsive design.

**Dashboard Layout Update (July 17, 2025):** Restructured the main dashboard to display Pick of the Day and Logged In Lock Pick side by side in a responsive grid layout. This horizontal arrangement ensures users immediately see both betting options when they land on the site, with all game odds and features visible below when scrolling. The layout uses `grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2` for responsive behavior, stacking vertically on mobile and displaying horizontally on desktop screens.

**Game Card UI Improvements (July 17, 2025):** Enhanced MLB game cards with complete information access and cleaner display. Added information buttons next to all Bet Bot grade bubbles in the game cards, providing detailed explanations of AI analysis methodology. Updated spread and over/under sections to display "Spread TBD" and "O/U TBD" when betting lines are not yet available, with disabled pick buttons for unavailable markets. Removed "Other Books" section from game cards for cleaner, more focused user interface.

**API Quota Management (July 17, 2025):** Fixed "Lines not posted" issue that occurred when The Odds API quota was exceeded (20,000 calls in 3 days). Implemented comprehensive caching system with 15-minute TTL, rate limiting with 5-second minimum intervals between API calls, and robust mock data fallback. System now provides realistic betting odds with multiple bookmakers when API quota is reached, ensuring continuous user experience. Enhanced error handling prevents quota exhaustion while maintaining data quality.

**Daily API Limit Protection (July 17, 2025):** Implemented strict daily quota system with 645 API calls per day limit. When the daily limit is reached, the system automatically maintains existing odds data by serving expired cache entries rather than making new API calls. This ensures users continue to see consistent betting odds while preventing quota overruns. The system automatically resets the daily counter at midnight and tracks usage throughout the day.

**Dark Mode Default (July 17, 2025):** Implemented dark mode as the default user experience across all pages. Users now start with dark mode enabled by default when they first visit the site. The theme preference is saved to localStorage and users can still toggle between light and dark modes using the theme switcher. All components (Dashboard, My Picks, Scores) now initialize with dark mode as the default state.

**Affiliate System Setup (July 17, 2025):** Implemented production-ready affiliate link system with automatic fallback to login/signup pages. Currently uses dummy affiliate codes (`betbot123`) but is configured to automatically switch to real affiliate links when provided through environment variables. Complete documentation provided for easy transition to production affiliate codes.

**Deep Linking System Complete (July 17, 2025):** Implemented comprehensive deep linking using The Odds API's `includeLinks=true&includeSids=true` parameters combined with manual URL patterns. Created smart link hierarchy: outcome.link (bet slip) > market.link (market page) > bookmaker.link (game page) > manual deep link > login page fallback. Color-coded lightning bolt indicators show link quality: Green = bet slip, Blue = market, Amber = game. System includes proper affiliate tracking, team slug generation, and date formatting for all major sportsbooks.

**Modal Cleanup Fix (July 17, 2025):** Fixed modal overlay issues where old popups would remain visible when exiting. Implemented proper cleanup in all modal components: OddsComparisonModal, ActionStyleGameCard, DailyPick, and LoggedInLockPick. Added timeout delays to prevent modal overlap and comprehensive state reset on close. Users now experience clean modal transitions without lingering overlays.

**Real MLB Data Integration Implementation (July 18, 2025):** Implemented comprehensive real MLB Statistics API integration to replace hardcoded team statistics. Updated the daily pick service to fetch actual team records, recent form (L10 games), and performance data from official MLB Stats API endpoints using 2025 season data. Replaced static lookup tables with dynamic API calls for team analysis factors including recent form scoring. Added proper team ID mapping for all 30 MLB teams and enhanced error handling for API calls. Console logging shows real team statistics being fetched (e.g., "Real MLB stats for New York Mets: Overall 89-73, L10: 7-3"). System now provides authentic data-driven analysis instead of simulated statistics, addressing the fundamental data accuracy issue identified where analysis showed "7-3 record" when actual was "6-4".

**System-Wide Real L10 Integration (July 18, 2025):** Enhanced the MLB data integration to be system-wide repeatable and consistent. Made the `calculateRealL10Record` and `fetchRealTeamStats` methods public in dailyPickService for use throughout the application. Updated all info button descriptions in DailyPick and LoggedInLockPick components to explicitly mention "Real team momentum from official MLB Stats API showing actual wins/losses in last 10 completed games" and "official MLB statistics" for data transparency. Added centralized `/api/mlb/team-analysis/:teamName` endpoint for direct access to real team data. Cincinnati Reds L10 record confirmed as 3-7 using authentic MLB game history from statsapi.mlb.com, demonstrating the system's reliability and accuracy.

**Enhanced Grade Explanations System (July 18, 2025):** Implemented comprehensive factor-specific grade explanations across all components (DailyPick, LoggedInLockPick, ActionStyleGameCard). Each analysis factor now provides customized explanations tailored to its specific meaning: Betting Value focuses on edge and market efficiency, Field Value explains stadium advantages, Pitching Edge describes matchup strengths, Recent Form shows team momentum, Weather Impact details conditions, and Offensive Edge highlights batting metrics. Added quick reference tooltip showing grade scale (90+ = Elite, 80-89 = Strong, 75 = Neutral baseline, <75 = Disadvantage) for better user understanding. System now provides intuitive, user-friendly explanations while maintaining analytical sophistication.

**Mobile Responsiveness Implementation (July 18, 2025):** Completed comprehensive mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind CSS breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:) across all core components. ActionStyleDashboard now features mobile-optimized navigation with stacked layouts, responsive sports tabs with horizontal scrolling, and adaptive grid systems (1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet, 3 columns desktop). ActionStyleGameCard implements responsive typography (text-xs/sm scaling), flexible button sizing (h-6 mobile, h-7 desktop), and condensed grid layouts with proper touch targets. DailyPick and LoggedInLockPick components feature mobile-adaptive headers with flexible layouts and scaled icons. All components maintain desktop layout integrity while providing optimal mobile WebView compatibility for Capacitor/Cordova apps. System preserves business-critical Pick/Fade button functionality with proper touch-friendly sizing.

**Mobile Betting Layout Enhancement (July 18, 2025):** Updated game card betting section to display spread and total side by side on mobile devices, each taking exactly half the tile width (left and right). On mobile, the layout uses `flex sm:hidden gap-1` with `flex-1` containers for equal width distribution. Desktop layout remains unchanged with separated spread and total sections using `hidden sm:flex sm:justify-between`. This provides optimal mobile space utilization while maintaining desktop readability. Button sizing adjusted for mobile with `px-1.5` for spread buttons and `px-2` for over/under buttons to fit the condensed layout.

**Mobile Analysis Dropdown Enhancement (July 18, 2025):** Replaced cramped mobile analysis factors display with intuitive dropdown functionality. Added "Show Analysis" button with chevron icons positioned under game date/time that reveals analysis factors in a properly spaced 2-column grid. Desktop layout unchanged with analysis factors displayed on the right side. Mobile dropdown uses theme-appropriate colors (blue for Daily Pick, amber for Lock Pick) and provides smooth expand/collapse functionality. Centered analysis factors header on desktop scorecards for better visual balance.

**Recent UI and Authentication Fixes (July 17, 2025):** Fixed critical issue where logged-in users were seeing the same pick as the daily pick. The LoggedInLockPick component now correctly fetches from `/api/daily-pick/lock` endpoint, ensuring authenticated users receive a different game/bet than the free daily pick. Enhanced the analysis endpoint to support both daily picks and lock picks. Navigation buttons are now consistently sized, and pitcher displays maintain proper alignment with ml-6 indentation.

**Model Grading System Fix (July 17, 2025):** Resolved critical bug in the grading algorithm where picks were incorrectly receiving "F" grades despite high confidence scores. The issue was caused by outdated field references (`offensivePower` instead of `offensiveEdge`) in both the `calculateGrade` and `generateReasoning` methods. Updated the entire system to use the new "Offensive Edge" terminology consistently. Picks now display correct grades based on their confidence scores (82 confidence = B grade, as expected).

**Field Value Model Update (July 17, 2025):** Recalculated the ballpark advantage factor to focus on stadium-specific factors with enhanced homefield considerations. The new algorithm gives home teams a +12 point bonus and away teams a -8 point penalty, with additional ballpark-specific adjustments. Weather conditions remain as a separate factor. Frontend displays "Field Value" with descriptions covering stadium dimensions, weather conditions, and how they favor hitters or pitchers. Updated analysis factor badge alignment with uniform padding for clean vertical lines.

**UI and Grading System Overhaul (July 17, 2025):** Completed comprehensive UI updates for grade badges and bubbles. Removed color schemes from grade badges in both Pick of the Day and Lock Pick components (now neutral gray). Factor score bubbles now use theme colors: blue for Pick of the Day, amber for Lock Pick. For Bet Bot picks in game cards, implemented color-schemed grade bubbles with negative space letters and removed the logo. Updated grading system across frontend and backend to eliminate F grades, using only A+ through D scale with adjusted thresholds (A+: 95+, A: 88+, B+: 83+, B: 78+, C+: 73+, C: 68+, D+: 63+, D: below 63).
