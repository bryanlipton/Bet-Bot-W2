# How to Get Files to Your Computer

## Current Location
The JSON files are in your Replit workspace, not on your local computer yet.

## Option 1: Download from Replit (Easiest)
1. In Replit file explorer (left sidebar)
2. Right-click each file:
   - betting-strategies.json
   - historical-results.json  
   - team-analysis.json
   - betting-glossary.json
3. Select "Download" for each file

## Option 2: Real-Time Connection Options

### A) Custom GPT Actions (Recommended)
Connect your Custom GPT directly to your live Replit app:

**In Custom GPT Actions, add:**
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: Bet Bot Live Data API
  version: 1.0.0
servers:
  - url: https://your-replit-app.replit.app
paths:
  /api/betting/live-strategies:
    get:
      summary: Get current betting strategies
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Current strategies and edge calculations
  /api/baseball/latest-results:
    get:
      summary: Get latest backtest results
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Most recent performance data
```

### B) Auto-Updating Knowledge Base
Create an endpoint that exports fresh data:

1. Add route to serve updated JSON files
2. Custom GPT fetches latest data on demand
3. Always gets current performance metrics

### C) Webhook Updates (Advanced)
Set up webhooks to notify Custom GPT when data changes:

1. Replit app sends update notifications
2. Custom GPT refreshes its knowledge
3. Always stays synchronized

## Best Approach for Real-Time Updates

**For live connection:** Use Custom GPT Actions to connect directly to your Replit app
**For periodic updates:** Manual file uploads when you want to update the knowledge base
**For testing:** Download files now and upload to get started quickly
