The advanced metrics support backing this lineup's production potential.",
  medium: "Solid offensive fundamentals provide a stable foundation for tonight's play. The team shows consistent contact quality with decent barrel rates, though they'll need to elevate their approach against quality pitching. Look for situational hitting to drive the betting edge.",
  low: "This offense faces notable challenges that create contrarian betting opportunities. Recent struggles with barrel rate (5.8%) and exit velocity indicate potential value in fading the public perception. Advanced metrics suggest caution on over bets."
};

const pitchingMatchupSamples = {
  high: "Tonight's starting pitcher brings elite stuff that dramatically shifts the betting equation. With a 3.50 ERA and dominant strikeout metrics, expect runs to be at a premium. The advanced analytics strongly favor backing this pitching performance.",

  low: "Recent struggles (4-6 L10) present potential contrarian value for sharp bettors willing to fade the public. Sometimes the best plays come when backing quality teams experiencing temporary rough patches."
