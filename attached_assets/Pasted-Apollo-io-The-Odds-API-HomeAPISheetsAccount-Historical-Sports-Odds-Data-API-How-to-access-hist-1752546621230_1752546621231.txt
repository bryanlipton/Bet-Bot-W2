#Historical Odds Data
Historical odds data is available for all sports and bookmakers covered by The Odds API. Historical data is available as snapshots, which include events and bookmaker odds as they were at a point in time.

Historical odds data for featured markets is available from June 6th 2020, with snapshots taken at 10 minute intervals. From September 2022, historical odds snapshots are available at 5 minute intervals.

Historical odds data for additional markets, including player props, period markets and more, is available from May 3rd, 2023. Snapshots are available at 5 minute intervals.

Historical data is only available on paid usage plans.

#How to access historical odds data
#Historical odds data for featured markets
Featured markets include the most popular betting markets and are prominently displayed by bookmakers. Historical odds data for featured markets is available in JSON format using the API's historical odds endpoint.

#Example API Request

The historical odds API will return the closest snapshot equal to or earlier than the provided date parameter. The usage quota cost for the historical odds endpoint is 10 per region per market (more info).
