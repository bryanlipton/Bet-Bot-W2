What We Do
Bet Bot levels the playing field between bettors and sportsbooks by providing access to the kind of data and analysis typically reserved for professionals. From predictive picks to transparent performance tracking, we help users bet smarter with tools designed for clarity, not clutter.

Key Features
Machine Learning-Driven Picks
Bet recommendations are generated daily by a proprietary machine learning model built in TensorFlow.js. It analyzes over 27 input features including team statistics, pitching matchups, park effects, umpire data, and weather conditions to identify profitable betting opportunities.

Live Odds Comparison
Instantly view odds from major U.S. sportsbooks including FanDuel, DraftKings, Caesars, and BetMGM with deep links to place bets directly.

Confidence Grading
Every pick is scored from A+ to D based on six core evaluation metrics such as offensive efficiency, pitching matchups, and market inefficiencies. This helps users quickly understand where value may exist.

Performance Tracking
Users can log bets, monitor outcomes, analyze ROI and win rates, and build or track parlays. The system supports configurable units and automatic status grading.
