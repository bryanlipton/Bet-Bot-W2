Yes — **deep linking directly into a bet slip (pre-filled pick)** is *possible*, **but only supported by a few sportsbooks** and typically **not through public APIs**. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

## ✅ **Can You Deep Link into a Pre-Filled Bet Slip?**

### Short Answer:

* **Yes, but only for certain books** that explicitly support it via structured URLs or SDK integrations.
* There's **no universal API** that works across all sportsbooks.
* Most deep links are **manually constructed using URL parameters**, and you need to know:

  * **Event ID**
  * **Market type** (e.g. spread, moneyline)
  * **Outcome ID or selection ID**

## 🔍 Examples of Deep Linking to Bet Slips

### 🟢 **DraftKings**

* DraftKings allows limited deep linking via structured URLs:

  ```
  https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/leagues/baseball/mlb?category=game-lines&event={event_id}
  ```
* You can’t always drop directly into the bet slip with a pre-selected wager, but you can **link to a specific market**, which gets the user *very close*.

> ❗ *You need internal event/market IDs that The Odds API does not always expose.*

### 🟢 **FanDuel**

* FanDuel supports **deep linking to specific games and markets**, like:

  ```
  https://www.fanduel.com/sportsbook/mlb/{team-name}-{date}
  ```
* Direct-to-slip with bet pre-selected: ❌ **Not officially supported** without a FanDuel SDK.

### 🟡 **BetMGM / Caesars / Others**

* Most support basic deep links to:

  * A **sport homepage** or
  * A **game page**
* Deep linking to pre-filled slips: ❌ Not generally supported.

## 🛠️ How Do You Build These Links?

### Option 1: **Reverse-engineer links manually**

* Visit each sportsbook, build a bet in the slip, and copy the final URL.
* Look for consistent URL patterns — many include:

  * Market ID
  * Event ID
  * Bet type (e.g. `moneyline`, `spread`)

#### Example (DK pattern):

```
https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/leagues/baseball/mlb?category=game-lines&event=gameId123456
```

### Option 2: **Check for a Partner SDK or API**

Some books (esp. those with affiliate programs) offer **private APIs or SDKs** for:

* Deep linking directly to pre-filled bets
* Tracking conversions
* Embedding mini betslips

To access:

* You must be an **approved affiliate**
* Ask your affiliate manager for **deep link documentation or tools**

## 🚫 Why There’s No Public API for This

* **Bet slip APIs are sensitive** because placing a bet involves money and KYC.
* **Security + legal compliance** prevent books from letting 3rd parties pre-fill or place bets through open APIs.
* That’s why they rely on **links and partnerships**, not open API calls.

## 🔑 Best Current Solution

If you're not yet an approved affiliate partner with API access:

1. **Use structured deep links** to the game/market (best possible UX right now).
2. **Highlight the bet in your UI**, so when they land on the sportsbook page, they know exactly what to select.
3. **Track conversion with your affiliate tag** (e.g. `?affid=123`).
