Sharps are taking a position on the MLB All-Star Game over/under Tuesday.

The MLB All-Star Game takes center stage at Truist Park in Atlanta with first pitch scheduled for 8 p.m. ET. As always, we’re turning to PRO Report to zero in on the most promising betting opportunities. Subscribers of PRO Report benefit from expert analysis, big-bet alerts, detailed projections and critical trends that can help separate sharp plays from guesswork.

Starting on the mound for the American League’s Detroit Tigers is Tarik Skubal, while the National League’s Pittsburgh Pirates will send Paul Skenes to the hill. The moneyline betting is evenly split between the two sides. Meanwhile, the over/under for total runs scored is widely pegged around the 7-run mark.

Let's dive into a detailed pick for Tuesday's MLB odds.
