With support for a wide range of sports and leagues worldwide, TheSportsDB API is designed for developers, enthusiasts, and startups looking to integrate reliable sports data without the hassle of expensive subscriptions. Get started today and bring the game to life in your application!


Free vs Premium
We offer a free API that anyone can use. The site originally had all methods available to use under the free API with no limits, but sadly it became too popular and was abused. So over the years we have had to limit certain methods, while trying to keep the core functionality. The Free API should work in many use cases, so please do test it out.

The current free API key is: 123
Premium API keys can be found on your user profile, once upgraded.

The Premium API includes all methods in V1 with larger limits as well as some extra stuff like livescores and video highlight links. Premium also allows you to use the more modern V2 API. You can find your Premium API key on your user profile if you are a supporter.




API v1 vs v2
The v1 API was written over 10 years ago and has been addded to since with many extra features. It uses basic PHP code to produce JSON objects that are returned to the user. API users are authenticated with a simple numeric API key in the URL. The naming is a little messy and the authentication is not great, as the key is visible to anyone who wants to poke around your web requests. Saying that, it works and is simple to use and easy to test in any web browser. Ideal for beginners!

V2 API is more modern and verbous API. This means it should be easier to understand in a logical way. It also uses more modern authentication requiring the API key to be sent in the header. When something goes wrong, the API will return standard HTTP response codes. V2 is only for premium subscribers and will be the only version developed going forward.


Base URL
The Base URL is a crucial element for making API calls, enabling you to clearly specify the root URL(s) for API requests. When making API calls, you combine the base URL with the specific endpoint path to form the complete request URL.

v1 Base URL = https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json
v2 Base URL = https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v2/json


V1 Authentication
v1 of the API has a very simple authentication process. Simply use the base URL above and append the number /123/ to the URL for the test key or replace with your premium API key.

Using the free key:
https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/123/searchteams.php?t=Arsenal
Using your premium API key:
https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE/searchteams.php?t=Arsenal
You can see an example below using a simple web browser using the free '123' API key:

Httpie Example Auth

V2 Authentication
v2 takes a more secure, modern approach to Authentication.
When sending a request to the API base URL, you must include API key in the header using this attribute 'X-API-KEY'.

You can see an example below using the popular free API testing software: Httpie

Httpie Example Auth


Images
Our site has a huge amount of images for things like events, players and teams. Most are fan created.
There are 2 types of images available. JPEG fanart and transparent PNG mostly used for badges and logos.
You can see the different types of artwork and sizes on this page.
You can access any image from the front-end using the image URL from the returned JSON data.

Preview Images
Most of the time you won't want to download the original large image, just get a small preview.
This is possible simple by appending '/medium', '/small', '/tiny' onto the end URL. This will give you a smaller version.

Original 720px- /league/fanart/xpwsrw1421853005.jpg
Medium version of league fanart
Medium 500px - /league/fanart/xpwsrw1421853005.jpg/medium

Tiny 50px - /league/fanart/xpwsrw1421853005.jpg/tiny

Rate Limit
The site has different rate limits for different levels of users. You will recieve a "429" http header if you breach the limit, then you will need to wait another minute until requests will work again. We enforce these not just to differentiate our tiers, but to keep the overall performance of the site stable.

OpenAPI / Swagger

Introduction
openapi logo

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to HTTP APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

An OpenAPI Description can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.
