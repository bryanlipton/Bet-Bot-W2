what about umpires, weather, starting pitcher probable stats, where to find these for free for upcomin games


ChatGPT said:
Here are free and accessible data sources you can integrate into a baseball model for umpires, weather, and starting pitchers (probables) on upcoming MLB games:

⚾ Umpires
Sportradar MLB v8 API

Endpoint: /officials

Description: Returns the full list of umpires (with IDs, experience, etc.)

MLB Stats API (Unofficial)

You can infer umpire IDs or names indirectly via game boxscore feeds—but Stats API doesn't provide umpire assignments natively. However, Sportradar is your best free route here.

🌦 Weather for Upcoming Games
Swish Analytics MLB Weather

Webpage: Shows probability of precipitation, temps, wind per schedule 
Swish Analytics
.

Automating access: Scrape or parse their daily schedule pages for up-to-date weather outlooks per game.

Standard Weather APIs

OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, Visual Crossing all offer:

bash
Copy
Edit
GET /forecast/hourly?lat={stadium_lat}&lon={stadium_lon}
Map each ballpark to coordinates and fetch 48‑ or 72‑hour hourly forecast (temp, wind, humidity)—crucial for modeling park/time-weather influences.

🎯 Probable Starting Pitcher
MLB Stats API

Query suspended schedule:

bash
Copy
Edit
GET https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/schedule?sportId=1&startDate=YYYY-MM-DD&endDate=YYYY-MM-DD&hydrate=probablePitcher
Returns upcoming games with probable pitchers and their playerId

Then separately call:

bash
Copy
Edit
GET https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/people/{playerId}/stats?stats=season&season=2025
This gives their 2025 ERA, WHIP, K/9, etc.

External APIs	OpenWeatherMap etc. via stadium lat/long

✅ Workflow Steps
List upcoming games → MLB Stats API /schedule + hydrate probables.

Fetch pitcher stats → people/{id}/stats?season=2025.

Fetch umpires → Sportradar /officials.

Fetch weather → Use weather API or scrape Swish per home stadium.

💡 Integrating into Your Model
Umpire IDs → factor in umpire biases (later add dynamic pitcher-specific strike zones).

Pitcher stats → ERA, WHIP, K/9, FIP, etc. build from “people” stats.

Weather → temp, wind speed/direction, humidity influence run scoring or batted ball flight.

Combining → Merge all data sets keyed by game ID for modeling.

Let me know if you'd like sample Python client code, handling rate limits, or tips on merging spatial stadium/weather data!
