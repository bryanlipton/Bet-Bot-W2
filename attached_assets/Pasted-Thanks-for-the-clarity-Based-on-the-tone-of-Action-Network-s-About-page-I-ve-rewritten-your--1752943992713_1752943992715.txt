Thanks for the clarity. Based on the tone of **Action Network’s** About page, I’ve rewritten your **Bet Bot** "About Us" section to sound more **professional, informative, and grounded**—with no gimmicks, just a clean, official tone focused on usefulness and purpose.

## About Bet Bot

**Bet Bot is a data-driven sports betting platform built to deliver accurate, actionable insights.**

We use artificial intelligence, machine learning, and real-time data integration to help bettors make smarter decisions—without the need for spreadsheets or hours of research.

### What We Do

Bet Bot provides users with reliable daily picks, odds comparisons from major sportsbooks, and tools to track performance—all powered by official data sources and advanced analytics.

While sportsbooks rely on vast teams and proprietary models, everyday bettors often rely on instinct. Bet Bot aims to close that gap, giving individuals access to a professional-grade betting assistant.

### Key Features

* **AI-Powered Daily Picks**
  Picks are generated every morning at 2 AM EST using models built with 27+ statistical features, including data from Baseball Savant, official MLB APIs, and weather conditions.

* **Live Odds Comparison**
  Real-time odds from leading sportsbooks including DraftKings, FanDuel, Caesars, and BetMGM—refreshed every 15 minutes and linked directly to the bet slip.

* **Transparent Confidence Grading**
  Each pick is assigned a grade from A+ to D, reflecting confidence levels based on six analytical factors such as offensive production, pitching matchup, and market inefficiencies.

* **Bet Tracking and History**
  Log picks, track performance over time, and view detailed metrics like ROI, win rate, and betting trends. Parlay support and unit-based tracking included.

* **User Profiles and Community**
  Optional public profiles with follower systems, privacy controls, and performance visibility allow for connection without compromising data ownership.

* **Mobile-First Design**
  Bet Bot is optimized for mobile use, with touch-friendly layouts and responsive grids that adapt to any screen size.

### Data Integrity

All data used by Bet Bot comes from official sources. No simulations, no biased inputs—just verified statistics and real-time game conditions. Picks update automatically as lineups change or games begin.

### Our Technology Stack

* **Front-End:** React, TypeScript
* **Back-End:** Node.js, Express
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Live Features:** WebSockets for real-time updates
* **AI/ML:** TensorFlow\.js

### Responsible Use

Bet Bot is intended for informational and educational purposes. Betting carries risk, and past performance does not guarantee future outcomes. Users are encouraged to gamble responsibly.
