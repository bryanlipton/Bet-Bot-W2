Mystics vs. Sparks Preview
The Mystics are looking to extend their winning streak to four straight as they travel to Los Angeles in their final game before the All-Star Break. Washington is coming off a road win over the Storm in which it struggled from three, but was led by Brittney Sykes' 19 points.

Meanwhile, the Sparks have won two of their past three, but have struggled at home this season. Los Angeles is just 2-8 at home and a win tonight would give the Sparks back-to-back home wins for the first time this season.

Dano Mataya's Mystics vs. Sparks Prediction
This, for me, really comes down to Sparks. Dating back to June 11, 12 of their past 13 games would have gone over this posted number. Their defense just is atrocious and they're the worst defensive team in the league as they give up points at all three levels.

They really depend heavily on their starting five, so it's difficult for them to stay in games, even if they get ahead. They want to win this game, but the Mystics have great leadership and are coming off a nice win at Seattle in which they shot 3-for-14 from three, one of their worst three-point shooting performances on the season.

So, I expect a lot more shots to be made tonight and the opportunities are going to be there against the Sparks. I think the shots are going to come in bunches and they shouldn't have trouble getting to at least 86 in this game.

I also think the Sparks are going to battle. It should be an awesome game — not a blowout — and I expect it to be like an 88-86 game.

Best Bet: Over 164.5
